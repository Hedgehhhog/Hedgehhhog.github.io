I am Jiahui Xie, a Master of Design student at the School of Landscape Architecture and Fine Arts, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, majoring in Environmental Art and Theory, with a research interest in the analysis and evaluation of urban public space. I continued to study urban heritage and spatial analysis, combining field research and quantitative analysis to construct a scientific spatial perception assessment system, and I have published a number of academic papers in core journals on the inheritance of intangible arts and crafts and the design of urban roaming paths. In addition, I have actively participated in a number of public space renovation projects and accumulated rich practical experience.
