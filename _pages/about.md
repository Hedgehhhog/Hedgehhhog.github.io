Master of Design Student, School of Landscape Architecture and Fine Arts, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University
Specializing in Environmental Art and Theory | Research Focus: Urban Public Space Analysis and Evaluation

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Design at the School of Landscape Architecture and Fine Arts at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, with a focus on Environmental Art and Theory. My research primarily explores the analysis and evaluation of urban public spaces, with an emphasis on integrating field research and quantitative methods to construct a scientific spatial perception assessment system.

In addition to my academic endeavors, I have conducted in-depth studies on urban heritage and spatial analysis, and have published several papers in core academic journals. These publications address topics such as the preservation of intangible arts and crafts and the design of urban roaming pathways.

Beyond academia, I have actively participated in multiple public space renovation projects, gaining extensive practical experience in the field. My work strives to bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world application, aiming to improve the functionality and aesthetic appeal of urban environments.
